# c2-load

This script is intended for use by teachers employed by C2 Education during the remote teaching period caused by COVID-19.

When run, this script will load C2 Education bluebook/red-binder Google sheets automatically from the schedule email for today's date (or another date if provided as an argument to the script in date format yyyy-mm-dd). Requires enabling both the Gmail and Google Drive APIs (running the script will prompt you to enable these automatically the first time it is run). The script will save some of the search information for quick, future lookup, and the directory this information is saved in needs to be set manually in your downloaded version of the code before running.
